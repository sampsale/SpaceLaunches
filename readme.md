# Site for spacelaunches 

Site for space launches. You can find the next 10 space launches with countdowns, current location of ISS on Google maps, people currently in space and search function for space agencies, launch sites, launch vehicles and astronauts. Done for practice on API-usage and Bootstrap.

Done with native JS and Bootstrap used for styling and mobile friendliness.

APIs used: http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json Google Maps api, https://lldev.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/upcoming/ , https://lldev.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/?search ,  

ISS location API not functional, since API-key is not on github.
